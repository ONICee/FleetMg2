## 3. Local Installation (XAMPP)

1. **Clone / copy** this repository inside `htdocs` and rename to `fleet` (so it lives at `C:/xampp/htdocs/fleet`).
2. **Create the database**:
   * Start MySQL from XAMPP.
   * Import `db/schema.sql` using phpMyAdmin or `mysql -u root < db/schema.sql`.
3. **Configure credentials** (if different):
   * Edit `config/constants.php` and update `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, or `BASE_URL`.
4. **Browse** to `http://localhost/fleet` â€“ you should see the login page.

## 5. Testing Guide

* Log in with each role to verify the correct dashboard and permissions.
* Add a new vehicle, then add maintenance records to ensure e-file linkage.
* Change global settings (as Super Admin) and confirm intervals are reflected in reminders.
* Download a CSV report from the Admin dashboard.
* Review **Audit Logs** to validate that actions are captured.

## 6. Security Checklist

* All database calls use **prepared statements** (PDO).
* Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** (`password_hash`).
* Session cookies are `HttpOnly`, `Secure` (when HTTPS), and `SameSite=Strict`.
* Input is sanitised with `htmlspecialchars` to mitigate XSS.

Happy managing! ðŸš€
